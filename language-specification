Language specification: (Model Checking paradigm)

Formulas that can be checked on the models (Satisfaction of a formula/preconditions):
formula1 : phi = prop | phi AND phi | NOT phi | [agent] phi 

Formulas that can be forced on the model as effect (changing the truth value of the respective such tath these become true as an effect):
formula : phi = prop | NOT prop | phi AND phi

In input file, we enforce Clause Normal Form.

While specifying Pre:
	formula = Conjuction of disjuctions (Clauses). Can have modal operators. 
	example : B(agent, th_agent) AND at_agent    (in this case each comjuct is an atomic disjunct)
	
While specifying Eff:
	formula = Conjuction of propostions (whose truth valuse changes)
	example : -at_agent
	(Directly it effects atoms but indirectly the beliefs of the agents changes too)
	
	
version 1: Without any inferencing actions
	   All (propositional) direct and indirect effects are explicitly encoded.
	   
version 2: With inferencing actions. Repeatedly apply inferencing actions upto a fixedpoint.
	   Need to implement Bisimulation.
